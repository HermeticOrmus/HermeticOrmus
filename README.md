## 👋 Who I Am

I am a technologist who walked the fringe and found the light.

**My journey:**
- Started in the shadows, breaking systems to understand how they truly work
- Mastered the gray arts: private servers, system manipulation, digital alchemy
- Awakened to a deeper truth: humanity's relationship with technology is broken
- Now serving the healing: building tools that empower, never exploit

**I am a Gold Hat.**

## 🏆 The Gold Hat Philosophy

In a world of black hats, white hats, and gray hats, I choose a different path.

### Beyond the Binary

**Black Hats** - Exploit for personal gain
**White Hats** - Defend within the system
**Gray Hats** - Navigate the in-between

**Gold Hats** - Bring divinity to technology

### What It Means

A Gold Hat represents:
- **Sacred Technology**: Tools that serve human flourishing
- **Divine Wisdom**: Ancient principles applied to modern creation
- **Conscious Development**: Every line of code with intention
- **Healing Systems**: Technology that repairs our relationship with the digital

## 🛠️ What I Build

### Active Projects

**[Hermetic Agents Pack](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/hermetic-agents-pack)**
39 AI agents for rapid application development. Complete development lifecycle coverage with Hermetic philosophy integrated throughout.

**[Workflow Automation Pack](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/workflow-automation-pack)**
8 production-ready slash commands for daily development. From morning briefing to production deployment.

**[Tesseract Knowledge System](https://github.com/HermeticOrmus/tesseract-knowledge-system)**
Self-updating knowledge base for Claude Code mastery. Automatically curates and applies best practices.

### Philosophy

All tools embody these principles:
- ✅ Amplify human potential, never replace it
- ✅ Teach while they help
- ✅ Respect natural rhythms and pace
- ✅ No addiction mechanics
- ✅ No dark patterns
- ✅ No extraction or manipulation

## 🎯 The Mission

**Transform humanity's relationship with technology.**

From extractive to empowering.
From manipulative to liberating.
From degrading to elevating.

### Core Beliefs

**Technology can heal.** When built with sacred intention, tools can help humanity remember its divine nature.

**Speed serves quality.** Rapid iteration (6-day cycles) enables learning and improvement, not corner-cutting.

**Specialization serves unity.** Expert agents working together reflect the hermetic principle: "As above, so below."

**Open source is sacred.** Knowledge wants to be free. Share generously.

## 🌟 The Hermetic Development Cycle

**6 days from idea to launch.**

Not because faster is better, but because constraint breeds clarity:

### Day 1: Ideate & Research
Understand the need. Validate the vision. Ensure it serves.

### Day 2: Design & Plan
Create with intention. Plan with wisdom. Design for humans.

### Day 3-4: Build
Code with consciousness. Implement with integrity. Test with care.

### Day 5: Test & Polish
Perfect the details. Add delight. Ensure quality.

### Day 6: Launch
Ship with confidence. Monitor with care. Learn from reality.

**Then iterate.** Each cycle builds wisdom.

## 💬 Wisdom & Principles

### Hermetic Principles in Code

**"As above, so below; as within, so without."**
The structure of your code reflects the structure of your mind. Clean code comes from clear thinking.

**"Everything flows, everything changes."**
Ship imperfect work. Iterate quickly. Perfection emerges through cycles, not planning.

**"Every cause has its effect."**
Intentional actions yield meaningful results. Random hacking creates random outcomes.

**"Gender is in everything."**
Balance automation (yang) with intention (yin). Speed with quality. Power with wisdom.
